Unlike regression where you predict a continuous number, you use classification to predict a category. 
There is a wide variety of classification applications from medicine to marketing. Classification models 
include linear models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and nonlinear ones like K-NN, Kernel SVM and 
Random Forests. 


Classification :
A machine learning technique to identify the category of new observations based on training data.


Logistic Regression : 
Predict a categorical dependent variable from a number of dependent variables.
